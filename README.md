# 👋 Hi, I’m Mahmoud Atiyah

**Business Growth Engineer | Web, Automation & Revenue Systems**

I design and build **growth systems** that help businesses turn websites into **lead and revenue engines**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **engineering, operations, automation, and marketing**—focused on outcomes, not buzzwords.

## 🧠 What I Do

I help businesses and founders:

- Build **high-converting websites & landing pages**
- Design **funnels and lead capture systems**
- Automate **CRM, follow-ups, and internal workflows**
- Improve **business operations using automation & AI**
- Optimize **SEO, performance, and scalability**
- Turn scattered tools into **one cohesive growth system**

I don’t just “build pages”—I engineer systems that **scale**.

## 📈 How I Think

- Systems > tools  
- Outcomes > aesthetics  
- Automation > repetition  
- Scalability > quick hacks  

If something doesn’t improve **efficiency, growth, or clarity**, it doesn’t belong in the system.
